DESCRIPTION:
This project involves building a simple AI chatbot using Python, NLP, and machine learning. The chatbot processes user input, predicts the intent using a trained model, and responds with appropriate answers from a predefined dataset (intents.json). It uses TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier to understand and classify text.


TOOLS:


NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
Used for basic NLP tasks such as tokenization (splitting text into words). It helps the chatbot break down and analyze input text efficiently.

TfidfVectorizer (from scikit-learn):
Converts text input into numerical values using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, allowing the machine learning model to process it effectively.

MultinomialNB (Naive Bayes Classifier):
A probabilistic classifier from scikit-learn, well-suited for text classification tasks such as predicting user intent based on tokenized input.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
Used for storing and loading the chatbot's training data, including sample user queries (patterns) and corresponding bot replies (responses).



APPLICABLE FOR:


Customer Support Systems:
Can be used in websites or applications to handle basic customer inquiries, improving user engagement and reducing support load.

Education & Learning:
Ideal as an introductory project for students learning about NLP, machine learning, and text classification using Python.

Virtual Assistants:
Forms the foundation of AI-based conversational systems that can be expanded with context awareness, dialogue flow, or voice integration.

Business Automation:
Can be integrated into small business systems to automatically handle FAQs, collect feedback, or direct users to appropriate services.
